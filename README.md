# Text-Classification-BBC-Data-Set

# Problem definition and solution approach :
Here, we are talking about a supervised learning problem. This means we need a labeled dataset so the algorithms can learn the patterns and correlations in the data. We fortunately have one available, but in real life problems this is a critical step since we normally have to do the task manually.

# Data-Set :
The dataset used in this project is the BBC News Raw Dataset. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/MarehanRefaat/Text-Classification-BBC-Data-Set/blob/main/Text_Classification_BBC_DataSet.ipynb.
It consists of 2.225 documents from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in five topical areas from 2004 to 2005. These areas are:
Business - Entertainment - Politics - Sport -Tech
