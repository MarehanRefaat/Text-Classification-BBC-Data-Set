# Problem definition and solution approach :
Here, we are talking about a supervised learning problem. This means we need a labeled dataset so the algorithms can learn the patterns and correlations in the data. We fortunately have one available, but in real life problems this is a critical step since we normally have to do the task manually.

# Data-Set :
The dataset used in this project is the BBC News Raw Dataset. It can be downloaded from 
It consists of 2.225 documents from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in five topical areas from 2004 to 2005. These areas are:
